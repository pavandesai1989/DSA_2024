https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-complete-trips/description/


minimum time can be 1, less than 1 can not possible.
maximum time can be (minimum element of given time array * total trips).
we use binary search to chose optimally minimum time that can be required to complete total trips
when number of trips completed by 'mid' time >= total trips, then our ans can be 'mid' time, but less than 'mid' time can be possible, so we reduce our search space.
when number of trips completed by 'mid' time < total trips, then our ans can not be 'mid' time, but greater than 'mid' time can be possible, so we increase our start to increase mid.
